LinuxFest Northwest is next weekend!

I'm breaking the program I wrote into individual components, following the Unix philosophy. I should give an overview of that as well.

Took screenshots of Bryan Cantrill's slides. I should make a slideshare and put them on it.

The *Unix philosophy* according to Doug Mcllroy:

* Write programs that do one thing and do it well
* Write programs to work together
* Write programs that handle text streams, because that is a universal interface

Bryan Cantrill:

> Four decades later, this philosophy remains the single most important revolution in software systems thinking!

Me:

> In case it isn't obvious, I say that this is because it allows our programs to be used in ways beyond that which we intended.
